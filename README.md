Code style doesn't matter, but keep these 3 rules:

  - Keep clean, readable, and consistent. Try to follow previous rules if it exist.
  - Avoid refactoring code style, and also write your code which don't need to do.
  - Respect others' code style, and keep in mind that your code style is not perfect.
